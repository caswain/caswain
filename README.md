## Welcome to My GitHub! 
### My name is Courtney Swain and I am a MD-PhD Graduate Student currently being trained in cancer immunology and bioinformatics research.

 - About Me
   
I am a current trainee at the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB) Medical Scientist Training Program (MSTP). As a MD-PhD Candidate in the Graduate Biomedical Science (GBS) program at UAB, I study the role of T cell tumor immunity in breast cancer under the mentorship of Lalita Samant, PhD. You can learn more about our research work and lab here: https://sites.uab.edu/lsamant/

I am also a cancer bioinformatician-in-training. I've recently set up my GitHub to serve as my portfolio for my current projects in data science, as well as a resource for those looking to get started with bioinformatics. I am also eager to learn more and to collaborate, so feel free to reach out to inquire about potential collaborative projects, questions, or tips!

 - Why I Code
   
It is becoming more obvious that there is a growing necessity for cancer research where scientists and clinicians need to be able to access, integrate, store, visualize, and explore omics datasets (i.e., genomics, metabolomics, proteomics) in order to discover new breakthroughs in cancer care and to strengthen our capabilities in personalized medicine. The most prominent way to accomplish this is through data science. I also envision that data science can aid in reducing challenges in acquiring and incorporating clinical data from diverse and underrepresented populations in medicine.

The National Cancer Institute has established a data science initiative to create and maintain data network that promotes accessibility and collaboration within the cancer research community.
